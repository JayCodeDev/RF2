# RF2
This is a compilation of useful MATLAB functions from my time in RF2.

The HW functions give some demos as to how to use the functions and what the inputs need to look like.
One of my favorite functions in here is the [h] = SmithCircle(x,y,r) function as it pretty accurately 
graphs the smith chart for whatever you need to do. It was super useful.
